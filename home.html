                        <h3>What is Coding ?</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Coding is the process of translating instructions from our language to the computer‚Äôs language. Specifically, machine language is written in binary terms (0s and 1s), so coders write their word-based instructions into an applicable format that the computer understands.</p>
                        <h3> Why Learn  to Code ?</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Learning to code is no longer a ‚Äúspeciality‚Äù skill. Rather, it has become a mainstream, core discipline utilized in nearly every industry; requiring more and more skilled workers every year.

                            Coding tests a variety of abilities. It hones problem-solving and analysis skills, such as finding errors and thinking logically. Further, coding often helps people develop teamwork and interpersonal skills since software and application projects are often cross-disciplinary and collaborative.
                            
                            Perhaps coding‚Äôs biggest attraction is that almost anyone can learn it. Aspiring coders don‚Äôt necessarily need to be experts in math or have vast prior experience. To get started, they simply need to be inquisitive, committed to learning, and willing to practice their coding skills regularly while learning from their mistakes. This accessibility makes coding a potential path for career switchers and brand-new professionals alike. </p>
